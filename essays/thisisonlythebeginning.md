Starting a new coding language can be tough. Especially, when you're so used to coding a certain way. With Javascript though, it is fairly simple. Image retrieved [here](https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-java-and-javascript-4777619).

## The Beginning 

At the beginning of this semester I didn't know what to expect. All of my classes were still online and I was stuck in my room. Out of all of my classes that I've taken this semester, I was the most excited for ICS 314. I really was and still am interested in learning about software engineering since this was my first experience ever. I didn't know what to expect but I was ready for whatever was coming my way!

## Coding Standards

I think the one thing that will stick with me the most would have to be coding standards. Having good coding standards is very important expecially when you're working with a group of people. Knowing the coding standards can help you out in the long run because if you see that there's an error, you'll be able to fix it right away. There are tools that can help out a ton with this such as ESLint. For most of the semester, we were using ESLint and I loved it. If there is an error in you code ESLint will tell you right away. Once you hover over the error, it gives you a very simple reason of why it is wrong so you can fix it.
