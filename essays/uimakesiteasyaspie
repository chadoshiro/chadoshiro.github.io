## Switching Majors

Learning something new is always a struggle at first. From countless hours trying to figure something out to just reading multiple websites trying to understand what they are talking about. We’ve all been there one way or another. In the end though, once you understand and know how to do whatever you are learning, it’s all worth it. For coders, like myself, trying to learn a new UI like Semantic UI, it can be a very daunting task. It’s practically a whole new language in and of itself. Taking time to learn Semantic UI has helped me out so much and I hope that it could help you too if you're a beginner or even an expert.Image retrieved [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).

## The Software Engineering World

Semantic UI is a great tool that you can use that will make coding that much easier. It is a user-friendly version of html. If you were to code in just html it would be very difficult compared to using Semantic UI. The best part about using Semantic is that it uses regular english instead of some cryptic wording. Since we get to use regular english we could actually guess anything that we wanted. Let’s say that we wanted an icon and you can’t find it. You could guess the name of the icon like “twitter icon” and now it could work. If you know english you’re already ahead of the game. The last part is understanding the different options that you have from making rows and columns, to making lists and menus. Learning the different options is so easy because you can just go to the [Semantic UI website](https://semantic-ui.com/) and they give out examples about all the different functions for each unique element that they have.

## Personal Experience with Semantic UI

Personally, I love Semantic UI. Even though I am still learning it and trying to remember how everything works, it is very easy to get the hang of. I like how you can just guess on the word that you want and it works instead of needing to search up everything you want. It saves up so much time using Semantic UI. Also since it uses regular english I don’t have to remember all these phrases to make things work. If I want a menu I can say menu or if I want to change the color of something then I can just say color and then change it to whatever color that I want. Finally, another cool thing that I like is that using a UI can make your page look ten times better. It makes your website cleaner and easier to look at. You could make websites without a UI but the quality of the website won’t compare.

## Conclusion

In conclusion using a UI such as Semantic UI can be very helpful when coding, but it is going to take some work to understand how to use it and how it works. Putting in the extra time it takes to learn it will be worth it in the end. If you want to make your life as a coder easier than there’s no better time than right now to get out there and learn a UI framework like Semantic UI!
