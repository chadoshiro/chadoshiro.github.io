Asking questions can be a very daunting task. You don’t know if you are asking the right question or even going to get a response. Maybe you don’t want to be a distraction or burden to one of your co-workers for constantly asking them for help. In this field of work though, it is important to be able to ask questions, especially when you have been stuck for a while on the same problem. Asking a “loser” question like “Is this right?” might not give you the answer you were looking for. Instead, asking a “smart” question could give you the answer that you were trying to figure out. This is a great way to not only get an answer back fast and correct, but it helps you to understand how to ask questions in the future that will help you get the answers you are seeking.

## "Smart" Questions



## "Loser" Questions
On the other hand, asking a “loser” question won’t give you the answer that you are looking for. In fact, you might not get an answer at all. It could just irritate and annoy the people that are trying to help you. A “loser” question could be just a broad question that has no background to the situation, which will result in not getting the right answer. It could also be where you immediately ask how to solve the problem without showing that you’ve actually tried solving the problem and finding the solution elsewhere. Remember that these people aren’t obligated to give you an answer. Out of their own kindness, they help people who need it. By asking “loser” questions you are showing them that you aren't worth helping. Here is an example of a bad question.

```

Q: Is this an infinite loop? beginner level

let I = 3;
while (i) {
  alert(I--);
}

Javascript the question asked what is the last value alerted by this code? and it shows the answer of 1. But I believe this is an infinite loop, and tested in console, resulting in laptop burning, had to shut down browser. Am I wrong or the solution was wrong? Thanks

```
This is a perfect example of what not to do. First off his question is if he was wrong or if the solution was wrong. This shows that he doesn’t care about understanding why he was either right or wrong. He just wants the answer and nothing else. Also he doesn’t show that he tried to find the answer somewhere else like asking a friend or searching it up on the internet. These experts aren’t going to want to answer your question if you don’t really want to learn from it. This is why at the time I am writing this there are no answers and there is also one downvote.
