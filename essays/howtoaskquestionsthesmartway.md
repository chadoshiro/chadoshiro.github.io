Asking questions can be a very daunting task. You don’t know if you are asking the right question or even going to get a response. Maybe you don’t want to be a distraction or burden to one of your co-workers for constantly asking them for help. In this field of work though, it is important to be able to ask questions, especially when you have been stuck for a while on the same problem. Asking a “loser” question like “Is this right?” might not give you the answer you were looking for. Instead, asking a “smart” question could give you the answer that you were trying to figure out. This is a great way to not only get an answer back fast and correct, but it helps you to understand how to ask questions in the future that will help you get the answers you are seeking.

let I = 3;
while (i) {
  alert(I--);
}

Javascript the question asked what is the last value alerted by this code? and it shows the answer of 1. But I believe this is an infinite loop, and tested in console, resulting in laptop burning, had to shut down browser. Am I wrong or the solution was wrong? Thanks
